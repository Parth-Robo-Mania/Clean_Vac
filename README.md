- This is my project which I designed as a part of a small Hack-a-thon when I was pursuing my Bachelor's degree.
- Our goal was to design a sanitization device to fight CoronaVirus.
- My aim was to design an automatic robot which could clean the whole house with minimal human intervention and non-contact cleaning.
- To achieve minimal human intervention, my plan was to introduce ROS for navigation and mapping using which the CleanVac can sanitize house using UV-C rays when instructed to do so.
